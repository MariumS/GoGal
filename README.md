# GoGal
This concept was developed for the HackItTogether Women's Hackathon held at Landers College for Women in February 2019, and ended up [winning 7th place](https://devpost.com/software/galgo). 
GoGal is a concept for a mobile app to link womxn with other female-identifying travel buddies for similar short trips.

# Inspiration
The idea behind this app is to improve safety and comfort of women travelling alone.
Every female knows the uncomfortable, uneasy feeling of commuting alone. Being alone makes you vulnerable to unwanted confrontation.

# Service: Female Travelling Buddy System
This app links you with other female-identifying persons who are traveling in a similar direction. The app allows you to select your preferred mode of travel, and has a built-in chat feature to coordinate a meet-up location with your new travel buddy and discuss whether you take the subway or order a shared ride. This concept showcases the [backend programming](GoGal_2019.ipynb) in Python and the potential [application interface](GalGo.pdf). 

# Next Steps
We are planning to develop a prototype website that will showcase the user experience. A user can sign up, become verified, and then start their journey by entering their start/stop coordinates and ideal arrival time. The app will search through a dummy database with starting and ending coordinates for other travelers to find your match.
