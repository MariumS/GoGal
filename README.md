Linking womyn to other fem travel buddies for similar short trips

# Inspiration
The idea behind this app is to improve safety and comfort of women travelling alone.
Every female knows the uncomfortable, uneasy feeling of commuting alone. Being alone makes you vulnerable to unwanted confrontation.

# What it do
This app links you with other female-identifying persons who are traveling in a similar direction. The app allows you to select your preferred mode of travel, and has a built-in chat feature to coordinate a meet-up location with your new travel buddy and discuss whether you take the subway or order a shared ride.
